MySQL Connector/Python is implementing the MySQL Client/Server protocol
completely in Python. This means you don't have to compile anything or MySQL
(client library) doesn't even have to be installed on the machine.

Disclaimer
=====================

!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!! EXPECT THING TO NOT WORK OR GO WRONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!! DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION etc.. etc... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ah, and make backups! :-)

Dependencies
=====================

* Python 2.4 or greater

Connects to:
* MySQL 4.1 or higher
* Will not work with MySQL servers using 'old passwords'!


Installation
=====================

* Install MySQL Connector/Python:

To install, you'll need Python 2.4 or greater.
Then, execute following (with proper permissions):

  shell> python ./setup.py install

setup.py will figure out which Python version you have and install the
correct modules.

Usage
=====================

* Check out the examples:

In the examples directory of the source distribution you will find config.py,
edit this file and change the connection settings for your MySQL server.
Once that done, you should be able to run the examples. If not, contact me!

 shell> ./engines.py

Python v3.1 users: The examples are in the py3k/ subdirectory.

Testing
=====================

Unit tests are provided and can be run using the unittests.py script. Mind
that you best edit the file so the connection parameters are correct for your
MySQL Server.
